# Seasons of Heartbreak

Seasons of Heartbreak is an NFT collection that explores the five stages of grief after a breakup: Denial, Anger, Bargaining, Depression, and Acceptance. Inspired by personal experiences and enriched by a connection with nature, this collection offers a profound and artistic view of emotional struggle and resilience. Each piece of art uses a distinct visual approach and is complemented by a narrative that invites reflection and healing.
